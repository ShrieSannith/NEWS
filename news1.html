            <h2>What are AI drones?</h2>
            <img src="images/AI-image.avif" alt="AI Drones" class="news-image">
            <p>The AI drones are small, flying robots equipped with advanced artificial intelligence and cameras. They are programmed to fly around Ikea’s distribution centres, where they scan and photograph product storage locations. Their main job is to keep track of inventory, making sure everything is in the right place and that stock levels are accurately recorded.</p>
            <p>These drones aren’t just simple machines- they’re smart. They use AI algorithms to navigate through the warehouse, even reaching the highest shelves where it’s difficult for humans to go. They can detect obstacles in their path and reroute themselves to avoid collisions, ensuring they don’t interfere with other operations.</p>
            <p><strong>How will these drones Work?</strong></p>
            <p>The drones operate around the clock, meaning they can perform inventory checks 24/7 without needing a break. This continuous operation is a significant upgrade from traditional inventory methods, which often require human workers to stop other tasks to count stock manually. With the drones, inventory checks are done automatically and more frequently, leading to faster and more accurate stock management.</p>
            <p>Each drone’s flight path is pre-scheduled, and they use a custom indoor positioning system to find their way through the warehouse. They’re specifically designed to handle the complex layout of Ikea’s distribution centres, including navigating high levels of storage (levels 3 and above).</p>
            <p>Once the drones capture the necessary data, it’s instantly processed and shared with the warehouse management system. This real-time data allows Ikea employees to make quick decisions, such as restocking items or reordering products that are running low.</p>
            <p><strong>What does this mean for Ikea employees?</strong></p>
            <p>For the workers at Ikea, these drones are more than just a tech upgrade; they’re a tool to make their jobs easier. Traditionally, inventory checks have been a labor-intensive task, requiring employees to physically climb ladders, move heavy items, and manually count products. With drones taking over this responsibility, employees are freed up to focus on more customer-centric tasks, like improving the shopping experience.</p>
            <p>Moreover, the drones reduce the physical strain on workers. By eliminating the need for repetitive, strenuous activities, the risk of injuries and fatigue is lowered. This shift not only improves employee well-being but also enhances overall productivity in the warehouse.</p>
            <p>Ikea has already tested these drones in a distribution centre in Winterslag, Belgium, and the results have been promising. Now, the company plans to expand this technology to more locations across Europe and North America. This move is part of Ikea’s broader strategy to integrate advanced technology into its operations, aiming to create a more efficient and safer working environment.</p>
            <p>In the coming years, we can expect to see these AI drones becoming a common sight in Ikea warehouses, quietly buzzing around as they help maintain the company’s massive inventory. For IKEA employees, these drones are more than just machines; they’re new coworkers that make the workday a little easier and a lot more efficient.</p>
