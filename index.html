            <img src="images/world1.avif" alt="Saudi official alleges forgery by Prince Mohammed">
            <h2>Former Saudi official alleges Prince Mohammed forged king’s signature on Yemen war decree</h2>
            <p>DUBAI, United Arab Emirates: A former Saudi official alleged in a report that Saudi Arabia’s Crown Prince
                Mohammed bin Salman forged the signature of his father on the royal decree that launched the kingdom’s years
                long, stalemated war against Yemen’s Houthi rebels.</p>
            <p>Saudi Arabia did not immediately respond to a request for comment over the allegations made without
                supporting evidence by Saad al-Jabri in an interview published Monday by the BBC, though the kingdom has
                described him as “a discredited former government official.” Al-Jabri, a former Saudi intelligence official
                who lives in exile in Canada, has been in a years-long dispute with the kingdom as his two children have
                been imprisoned in a case he describes as trying to lure him back to Saudi Arabia.</p>
            <p>The allegation comes as Prince Mohammed now serves as the de facto leader of Saudi Arabia, often meeting
                leaders in place of his father, the 88-year-old King Salman. His assertive behavior, particularly at the
                start of his ascension to power around the beginning of the Yemen war in 2015, extended to a wider crackdown
                on any perceived dissent or power base that could challenge his rule.</p>
            <p>In al-Jabri’s remarks to the BBC, he said a “credible, reliable” official linked to the Saudi Interior
                Ministry confirmed to him that Prince Mohammed signed the royal decree declaring war in place of his father.
                “We were surprised that there was a royal decree to allow the ground interventions,” al-Jabri told the BBC.
                “He forged the signature of his dad for that royal decree. The king’s mental capacity was deteriorating.”

            <h2>Chinese and Philippine ships collide again in disputed waters, and the countries are trading blame</h2>
            <p>TAIPEI, Taiwan: Chinese and Philippine coast guard ships collided at sea, damaging at least two boats, in an
                encounter early Monday near a new flashpoint in their increasingly alarming confrontations in the disputed
                South China Sea.</p>
            <p>Both blamed the other for the collision near Sabina Shoal, a disputed atoll in the Spratly Islands, where
                overlapping claims are also made by Vietnam and Taiwan. There were no reports of injuries.</p>
            <p>China’s coast guard accused the Philippines of deliberately crashing one of its ships into a Chinese vessel.
                Two Philippine coast guard ships entered waters near the shoal, ignored the Chinese coast guard’s warning,
                and intentionally collided with one of China’s boats at 3:24 a.m., a spokesperson said in a statement on the
                Chinese coast guard’s website.</p>
            <p>Jonathan Malaya, assistant director-general of the Philippine government’s National Security Council, accused
                the Chinese coast guard of disinformation for saying that the Philippine coast guard ships rammed its
                vessels. Video and photographs, including those taken by journalists from a US TV network who were on board
                one of the Philippine coast guard ships, showed that the Chinese ships caused the latest collisions in the
                high seas, Malaya told a news forum in Manila.</p>
            <p>The Philippines’ National Task Force on the West Philippine Sea said two of the coast guard’s ships, BRP
                Bagacay and BRP Cape Engaño, “encountered unlawful and aggressive maneuvers” from Chinese coast guard
                vessels while en route to Patag and Lawak islands, which are occupied by Filipino forces, in the contested
                region. “These dangerous maneuvers resulted in collisions, causing structural damage to both Philippine
                Coast Guard vessels,” the statement read.</p>

                    Championship in May this year with an effort of 69.50 metres.</p>
                <p>Sumit said, "My throws during practice have been quite consistent. I have worked hard on increasing strength
                    without changing my technique. I will try to improve my previous record."</p>
                <p>When asked about the pressure of being the defending champion and being the Indian flag bearer, he said,
                    "There is no pressure right now but things will be known after reaching Paris. Once you reach the Games
                    village or at the competition venue, things become a little different. I will try to do my best without
                    taking pressure. I want to enjoy this moment. For the first time, such a large and strong contingent from
                    India is going to the Paralympics and I feel proud to be the flag bearer," he added.</p>
                <p>The Indian contingent comprises 84 athletes across 12 disciplines for the Paralympics.</p>
                <p>This Padma Shri awardee said, "Being a flag bearer in an event like Paralympics is a different kind of
                    emotion. This is the first time I will be a part of the opening ceremony of the Paralympics. At the time of
                    the Tokyo Paralympics, there were a lot of restrictions due to the COVID-19 pandemic. I reached late there
                    according to the schedule of my competition." “I have been a part of the TOPS scheme since 2019 and since
                    that time I have been getting prosthetic legs from abroad. Along with my prosthetics, TOPS provides
                    everything I need for my game," he concluded.</p>

                <h2>Jannik Sinner edges past Alexander Zverev to meet Tiafoe in Cincinnati final</h2>
                <p><strong>CINCINNATI:</strong> Jannik Sinner ended his losing streak against Alexander Zverev with a 7-6
                    (11/9), 5-7, 7-6 (7/4) win on Sunday to set up a final in the Cincinnati Open against American Francis
                    Tiafoe.</p>
                <p>The world number one had lost four of five previous matches against the German, with his only win coming at
                    Roland Garros four years ago.</p>
                <p>The tight victory took more than three hours not including a rain interruption.</p>
                <p>The match was paused midway through the first-set tiebreaker for nearly 30 minutes while a shower passed over
                    the area -- another episode of the poor weather which has plagued the event in recent days.</p>
                <p>Sinner saved two Zverev set points and won the opener on his own third chance, only to fall in the second set
                    as he lost an early break and was broken again in the 12th game as he sent an overhead into the net.</p>
                <p>The third set went into a tiebreaker with Sinner taking a 5-2 lead and triumphing on his second match point.
                    "It was a tough match, a very exciting match," the Italian said. "We played in different conditions: sunny,
                    rain and then night."</p>
                <p>"There was a lot of tension for both of us. I'm very happy with my performance and happy to be in the final."
                </p>
                <p>Sinner, who won his last title on grass in Halle two months ago, will play a rare Monday final against the
                    winner from Frances Tiafoe and Danish 15th seed Holger Rune.</p>
                <p>"I had to play with my gut, I feel that is my strength," the 23-year-old said. "We had some ups and downs
                    over three hours."</p>
                <p>"I couldn't have played a better match than this to prepare," he said, looking ahead to the start of the US
                    Open in eight days.</p>
                <p>The player who has suffered recently with a hip problem, illness and the tonsillitis which forced him to skip
                    the Olympics, said he needs to keep up his fitness.</p>
                <p>"If I'm going to win bigger matches, I have to be more in shape. Today I stayed mentally strong; I'm proud of
                    that."</p>
                <p>Sinner will be playing in his fifth career Masters 1000 final.</p>
